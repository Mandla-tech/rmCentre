# rmCentre
A landing page for proposed website of local medical centre. 

The project showcases the inclusion of an icon next to the page title. 
There also is a navigation bar that would then be linked with other pages built in the website as it is further developed. The page also highlights what would be the proposed services available at the centre in form of buttons have been added at the top navigation bar. These buttons have a responsive functionality which prints out a brief description onclick. 
The gallery was made to display use of and inclusion of images in the page, as well as different font formatting in terms of headers, paragraphs and figcaptions.
At the very button of the page is the footer with year display and other information. 
The web page was written in HTML, with CSS styling and JavaScript was utilized to add functionality.

The webpage was an idea I had after seeing that this centre did not have web presence. (Unfortunately discussions of working on development for the website were turned down by the centre as apparently one was already being developed elsewhere)
